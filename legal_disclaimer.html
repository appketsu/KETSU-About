    KETSU is an interpreter of modules.
  </p>
        <p>
        KETSU is a tool that allows to adapt websites or utilities into KETSU via modules (Scripts), this modules contain the instructions for the app to work. KETSU doesn´t provide any modules nor promotes them.
      </p>
  
        <p>
       KETSU by itself can´t do anything unless you load a module on it, modules make the app function. 
      </p>
  
            <p>
       KETSU can be compared to a video player or an pdf viewer, this apps allows you to feed them pdf or videos so they can be used. KETSU is no different than this apps, but the difference is that it uses its own format called modules.
      </p>
        <p>
       KETSU modules don´t run on any external server, everything is executed on the users phone through different apis provided by apple to interact with the WKWebview such <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/1415017-evaluatejavascript" >evaluateJavascript()</a>
      </p>
  
      <p>
    The idea of KETSU is to be an app that adapts websites into app format, via modules. Offering all the extra features that KETSU has which make the interaction for the users more appealing and complete.
      </p>
  <p>
    The developer of ketsu is not responsible for any of the modules, KETSU doesn't distribute modules.
    ketsu by itself can't do anything besides load and intepret Modules. The code of the modules is in JSON format.
